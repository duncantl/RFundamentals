# R Fundamentals
## Recap

+ REPL
+ Parsing
  + language objects before evaluation
+ Evaluation
  + literal values - evaluate to same object - e.g. TRUE
  + symbols/variable names - lookup along search path - e.g. T
  + Environments
  + function calls - e.g., rnorm(1, 2),  rnorm(1, sd = 3)

---
# Environments

+ Environment - collection of (variable name, object/value) pairs
+ search() path
+ chain of environments
  + parent.env
+ showEnv
+ pass-by-reference/mutable

---
# [Rewind] Evaluation of Assignment
+ T in base and T = 0
   + regular assignment (T = 0, T <- 0) assigns in the caller's environment
+ illustrate with new environment on the search path
```
search()
find("a")
find("b")
```

--
```
e = new.env()
e$a = list(x = 1)
e$b = 1
attach(e)
```

--
```
find("a")
find("b")
```

---
# Assigning to a and b

```
a$y = 2
```
+ Where is `a`?

--
```
b = 3
```
+ Where is b?

---
# Assigning in place/to original variable
## Non-local assignment

+ Undo our local variables
```
rm(a, b)
```

+ Now consider
```
a$y <<- 2
```

--
+ Modify where variable is originally defined.


---
# attach()

+ Consider
```
mtcars
attach(mtcars)
mpg[3] = 100
```

+ How many `mpg` vectors are there ?
+ What do the following commands see for the mpg vector?
```
lm(mpg ~ ., mtcars)
sum(mtcars$mpg)
```
+ Don't use attach() for short-hand convenience,
   + i.e., not having to prefix `mtcars$mpg`
+ Use with()
```
with(mtcars, mpg + cyl)
```
+ But this is **non-standard evaluation**.
  + Doesn't follow the evaluation rules we have presented.

---
# Function Calls
     + call language object
     + find function by evaluating first element of call, e.g., rnorm,  x$fun
     + call frame - environment
        + create local variables in call frame for each parameter/formal argument
     + match arguments in call to parameters
     + evaluation of commands in the body of the function

---
# Matching Arguments to Parameters in a Call.

+ named arguments by exact match
   + named arguments by partial match to remaining parameters
   + remaining arguments to remaining parameters by position
   + ... is special
      + matches any named argument that doesn't match
      + matches additional positional arguments
      + named arguments that partially match, but not exactly, a named parameter after ... go to ... and do not match the partially matching parameter.

```
scatter.smooth(mtcars[, c("mpg", "wt")], , .75,
                xlab = "Weight", yla = "Miles per gallon",
                  main = "Motor Trend Cars Data")
```

+ match.call(scatter.smooth, call)

---
# ... and parameters

+ parameters after ... in the parameter list.
  `na.rm` in `sum`
```
sum
function (..., na.rm = FALSE)
   .Primitive("sum")
```
+ named arguments in a call that partially match, but not exactly, a named parameter after ... go to ... and do not match the partially matching parameter.

```
f = function(..., other = TRUE)
{
  browser()
}
```
```
f(1, 2, oth = 101)
Called from: f(1, 2, oth = 101)
Browse[1]> other
[1] TRUE
Browse[1]> list(...)
[[1]]
[1] 1

[[2]]
[1] 2

$oth
[1] 101
```

---
#


+ Consequence
```
sum(1, 2, na.rm = TRUE)
```
```
sum(1, 2, na.r = TRUE)
```



---
# Lazy Evaluation

+ R doesn't evaluate the arguments and then pass them to the function
  + it passes the expression/command for each argument
+ evaluates each argument when its value is first needed
+ in addition to expression, passes environment in which to evaluate that.
+ uses regular evaluation rules using that environment

---
# Querying an Argument, Call, Call Stack

+ a function can query the expression for a given argument
  + `substitute()`
```
substitute(x)
```

+ 

---
# Call Frame

+ sys.nframe()
+ sys.calls()
+ sys.frames(sys.nframe())


---
# Finding/Evaluating Variables in Body of a Function

+ rnorm
+ scatter.smooth
  + debug(`[`)
  + illustrates lazy evaluation
  + S3 method [.data.frame


---
# Environment of a Function

+ The *environment of a function* is the environment
  in which it is created.

+ Top-level function creation
+ source()
+ Explicitly setting the environment of a function.
+ Functions created in the body of a function.
  + **call frame** of the function in which it is created.
  + not the environment of the function in which it is created, but the call to that function.

---
# Closures/Generator Functions

+ Function returning a function.
+ Inner function captures the environment and its variables in which
  it was created
  + Call frame.

```
normalLikh = 
function(x)
{
   function(parm)
     prod(dnorm(x, parm[1], parm[2]))
}
```

```
x1 = rnorm(10)
x2 = rnorm(1000, 25, 4)
```

```
lik1 = normalLikh(x1)
lik2 = normalLikh(x2)
```
```
lik1(c(0, 1))
lik2(c(0, 1))
```

---
# Non-local Assignments

+ Maintain state across calls.
+ Count the number of calls to the eval() function during call to lm()
   + Each time eval() is called, call function to update non-local variable.

+ Create a function that returns a function.
  + Inner function updates non-local variable

---
# Non-local Assignments ctd.

```r
collect = 
function()
{
	count = 0L
	function() {
          count <<- count + 1L
      }
}
```

```
c1 = collect()
trace("eval", c1, print = FALSE)
lm(mpg ~ wt, mtcars, weights = rep(1, nrow(mtcars)))
```

```
ls(environment(c1))
environment(c1)$count
```
