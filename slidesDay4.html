# Note about Formula, Environments, Call Frames, Data, Memory!

+ Consider a function
```r
sim = function(N, numIter = 1000) {
   replicate(numIter, {
          x1 = runif(N)
          d = data.frame(x = x1, y = 10*x1 + 1 + rnorm(N))
          lm( y ~ x^2., d)
       }, simplify = FALSE)
}
```

+ Each element of z is an lm object and has a formula and that formula was created inside the call to sim()
  + the environment of the formula in each lm object

---
# Environments of `lm` objects

```r
sapply(z, function(l) environment(formula(l)))
[[1]]
&lt;environment: 0x7fb3544f52a0&gt;

[[2]]
&lt;environment: 0x7fb351e5ab30&gt;

[[3]]
&lt;environment: 0x7fb3464cc350&gt;
```

+ All are the call frames in which the environment was created

+  Examine the d and x1 variables within these environments
```r
sapply(z, function(l) dim(environment(formula(l))$d))
sapply(z, function(l) length(environment(formula(l))$x1))
```
    
---
# Data Types in R

+ vector types
   + no scalars, just vectors of length 1.

+ logical, integer, numeric, character, complex
   + in this order as values of one type can be coerced to the next type (to the right)
     without losing information.
```r
c(TRUE, 2L)
c(TRUE, 2L, 3.1415)
c(TRUE, 2L, 3.1415)
c(TRUE, 2L, 3.1415, "2.6")
```

+ What class is `NA`?

---
# NA

+ Computing on NA
```
x = c(1, NA, 3)
x == NA
[1] NA NA NA
```
+ Compare each value of x to NA
   + is 1 the same as NA ?
--
   + Value can only be unknown - we don't know if 1 is the same as a value we don't know

+ Need is.na()

---
# class() versus typeof()

+ typeof() tells us how the object is built
+ class() gives a human label for how to think about the object
   + methods for printing, plotting, etc.
   + higher-level concept than raw value.

```
class(Sys.Date()) - Date
typeof(Sys.Date()) - numeric
```

```
f = mpg ~ .
class(f)    # formula
typeof(f)   # language - a call to ~
```

```
fit = lm(mpg ~ ., mtcars)
class(fit)    # lm
typeof(fit)   # list
names(fit)
 [1] "coefficients"  "residuals"     "effects"       "rank"         
 [5] "fitted.values" "assign"        "qr"            "df.residual"  
 [9] "xlevels"       "call"          "terms"         "model"        
```

---
# Attributes

+ R objects can have attributes "hanging" off them
  + arbitrary list of name-value pairs

+ special recognized attribute names
  + class
  + names
  + dim
  + dimnames

+ `attributes(x)`
+ `attr(x, "id")`
+ `attr(x, "id") = value`

---
# Factors/Categorical types

+ factor() and ordered()
   + state abbreviations or names - AK, AL, CA, CO, AZ
     + alows grouping-by
     + arranged alphabetically but no implicit order
   + ordered categories, e.g.,
      + grades A+, A, A-, B+, B, B-
      + UG standing - Freshman, Sophmore, Junior, Senior

+ efficient representation
    + don't duplicate each value
    + instead, built as integer vector indexing a character vector
      + levels
```
f = factor( c("B", "A", "A+", "A-", "A") )
typeof(f) # integer
levels(f)
levels(f)[ f ]
```

+ Very useful feature of factors is subsetting using factors
  +  R treats it as an index of integer vectors
  + subset vector of same length as levels(f)
```
c("green", "lightgreen", "red", "orange", "gr"blue", "vals[ f ]
```
  + e.g. get colors, plotting characters for points.

---
# Dates and Times

+ Date and POSIXlt, POSIXct classes

+ Date
   + a numeric vector counting the number of days from 1970-01-01
   + birth of UNIX

+ POSIXct
   + an numeric vector counting the number of seconds since Jan 1, 1970 00:00
   + easily added as column in a data.frame

+ POSIXlt
   + contains details of the time, day, day within year, year, weekday, time zone, ..
   + returned by strptime(). Need to coerce to POSIXct.
   + Strange object
      + a list
      + names() returns NULL
      + but names(unclass(val)) returns
```
[1] "sec"    "min"    "hour"   "mday"   "mon"    "year"   "wday"  
[8] "yday"   "isdst"  "zone"   "gmtoff"


---
# matrix

+ vector of values with
   + a `dim` attribute - vector of number of rows and columns
   + a `class` vector indicating matrix.

+ array is extension of this
   + `class` attribute "array"
   + `dim`  vector with as many elements as dimensions, and values giving maximum of each dimension.
```r
array(1:24, c(2, 4, 3))   # 3 dimensional array of 2-D 2x4 matrices
```

---
# list

+ basic types have same type of elements
```
x = c(TRUE, 2L,  pi)  # numeric vector
```
+ Need for ordered container with different types for each element - **list**


---
# data.frame

+ Need for collection of columns with capability of different types for each column
+ data.frame is a list with constraint that all elements/columns have same number of elements/rows/records
+ Rarely use matrices except for
  + linear algebra - very powerful
  + result of sapply()


---
# Subsetting

+ General rule for base R data types
  + subsetting an object with [ returns an objet

+ 6 different ways for vector types
  + position/index  `x[ 1 ]`, `x[ 2:3 ]`
  + negative index  `x[ -1]`, `x [ - (2:3) ]` - omit elements
  + logical vector -
      + same length as vector being subsetted
      + elements corresponding to TRUE, kept
      + elements corresponding to FALSE, dropped/omitted
  + name
      + `x[c("a", "b", "f")]`
  + empty
      + all elements.  Equivalent to using `1:length(x)` (but that's bad idiom), `rep(TRUE, length(x))`
      + `x[]`
      + given `x = 1:10`, compare `x = 1` and `x[] = 1`
  + NA

+ can repeat an index or name
   + `x[ c("a", "a") ]`
   + `x[ c(1, 1, 2, 2) ]


---
# Edge/Corner cases

+ `x[ length(x) + 1 ] ?

--
  + NA

+ `x[integer()]` ?

--
  + same length as what we are indexing with, so 0 length.

---
# Lists
+ `[[` for extracting a single element from a list
    + returns the (single) element, not a list
    + x[2] returns a list with one element which is the second element of x.

+ l$elName
    + treats elName literally.  Doesn't find the value in the variable elName.
    + uses partial matching of element names
       + 

+ `l[[ elName ]]` - evaluates elName as a variable.

+ `l[[ c(2, 1, 3) ]]` - hierarchical indexing
   + `ll[[2]][[1]][[3]]`
   + `l[[i]]` can often be a mistake if i is not length-1 vector

+ When element name doesn't exist
  + returns NULL for l$noEl, l[["noEl"]]

+ Index by position beyond length
   + error
   + `list(a = 1)[[3]]`

---
# Two Dimensional Subsetting
+ 2-dimensional subsetting (and higher dimensions)
     + `x[i, j]` for data.frames and matrices and arrays generally.
     + i and j can be any of the 5 different ways above.

+ `x[characterV, ]`  - match row names
+ `x[, characterV]`  - match column names
   + `x[ characterV ]`  - since x is a list, index by column

---
# Subsetting Matrices **with Matrices**

+ M an r x c matrix
+  M [ logicalMatrix  ]
   + returns vector of elements corresponding to TRUE elements in logicalMatrix
   + M[ col(M) >= row(M) ] - upper-diagonal

+ Position indexing
    + Consider
```r
m = matrix(1:15,3, 5)
```

```r
idx = cbind(c(2, 3, 1), c(5, 1, 4))

     [,1] [,2]
[1,]    2    5
[2,]    3    1
[3,]    1    4
```
```r
m[idx]
[1] 14  3 10
```
+ But
```r
m[ c(2, 3, 1), c(5, 1, 4)]

     [,1] [,2] [,3]
[1,]   14    2   11
[2,]   15    3   12
[3,]   13    1   10
```
+ Same as
```
m[ c(2, 3, 1), ][, c(5, 1, 4)]
```

+ Returns a matrix

+ Again, repeated indices can be useful
```
m[ c(2, 3, 1, 2, 1), ][, c(5, 1, 1, 4)]
```
---
# Vectorization

+ element-wise operations
  + implicit, not explicit, loop
  + `x + y`,  `x > 0 & x < 2`,
  + `sum(x, y, z)`, `min(x, y, z)`, `cumsum(x)`

+ Compare
```
N  = 1e6; x = rnorm(N); y = rnorm(N)
system.time(x+y)
system.time(mapply(`+`, x, y))
```
   + N = 1e6 - .007 seconds versus 2.054 seconds - 293 factor
   + N = 1e7 - .057 versus 21.36 - 374 factor
   + N = 1e8 - .916 versus 368.5  - 402 factor

+ Why
   + 1 function call versus N function calls
     + accessing each pair of elements, call frames, matching arguments, evaluating body, 
   + for mapply, looping done in C so not cause of slowdown

---
# Vectorization Example

+ Revisit from last day. 18 million pairs of "words"
  + Saw how to avoid loop using two subsets
```
w = x[,1] < x[,2]
x[w, 3] = paste(x[w, 1], x[w, 2], sep = "_")
x[!w, 3] = paste(x[ !w, 2], x[!w, 1], sep = "_")
```

+ How do we create a sample data.set of two columns of "words"?

```
mkWord0 =
function()
{
    wordLen = sample(3:8, 1)
    chars = sample(c(letters, 0:9), wordLen, replace = TRUE)
    paste(chars, collapse = "")
}
```

```
col1 = replicate(N, mkWord0())
col2 = replicate(N, mkWord0())
```
+ N * 2 *2  calls to sample
+ 2 * N calls to paste


---
# Vectorized Word Generation

```
mkWord1 =
function(n)    
{
    wordLen = sample(3:8, n, replace = TRUE)
    chars = sample(c(letters, 0:9), sum(wordLen), replace = TRUE)
    tapply(chars, rep(1:n, wordLen), paste, collapse = "")
}  
```

+ Note can generate values for both columns in single call 
```r
tmp = mkWord1( 2 * N)
x = matrix(tmp, , 2)
```

+ 2 calls to sample
+ n calls to paste

+ 4 times faster for N = 1e6

+ can we do better? 
   + does it matter?




---
# Recycling Rule

+ R extends the shorter vector to the same length as the longer one.
  + warning if shorter one's length is not an exact integer multiple of longer one's length.
  + repeats elements using rep() operations
    + combines copies of the shorter matrix as many times as needed and omits any excess elements
```
rep(c(1, 2, 3), len = 5)
[1] 1 2 3 1 2
```   

+ Pay attention to warnings about no integer multiple lengths.
  + Nearly always an error in earlier computations.


---
# Writing Functions

+ Keep functions in separate file from script that uses them.
   + Can `source()` separately.
   + Byte-compile once, not each time.
   + Easier to test separate from entire script.
   + Can create alternative versions with same names and substitute these.

+ Short functions that do one specific task
   + Then short functions that call several of these to do higher-level task.

+ Create simple, "obvious" version
  + Then alternative "clever" version.
  + Compare results with first, gold-standard.

---
# Group Related Lines of Code to a separate Function

+ From .check_packages function in tools package.
```r
  now_local <- Sys.time()
  any <- FALSE
  checkingLog(Log, "for future file timestamps")
  ## allow skipping clock check on CRAN incoming systems
  if(config_val_to_logical(Sys.getenv("_R_CHECK_SYSTEM_CLOCK_", "TRUE"))) {
      ## First check time on system running 'check',
      ## by reading an external source in UTC
      now <- tryCatch({
          foo <- suppressWarnings(readLines("https://worldtimeapi.org/api/timezone/etc/UTC",
                                            warn = FALSE))
          ## gives time in sub-secs

      }, error = function(e) NA)
      if (is.na(now)) {
          now <- tryCatch({
              foo <- suppressWarnings(readLines("http://worldtimeapi.org/api/timezone/etc/UTC",
                                                warn = FALSE))
              ## gives time in sub-secs
              as.POSIXct(gsub(".*\"datetime\":\"([^Z]*).*", "\\1", foo),
                         "UTC", "%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S")
          }, error = function(e) NA)
      }
      if (FALSE && is.na(now)) { ## seems permanently stopped

              foo <- suppressWarnings(readLines("http://worldclockapi.com/api/json/utc/now",
                                                warn = FALSE))
              ## gives time in mins
              as.POSIXct(gsub(".*\"currentDateTime\":\"([^Z]*).*", "\\1", foo),
                         "UTC", "%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M")
          }, error = function(e) NA)
      }
```
---
# Improve code

+ Move entire block of code in `if()` to a function
  + Combines to get the official time
  + Name/action - `getUTCTime()`, `getOfficialTime()`, `getNow()`, `now()`?

+ 3 tryCatch() calls.
   + 1 is never run.
   + all 3 look remarkably similar
     + only difference is URL being used.
     + make single function

+ See [getUTC.R](getUTC.R)

---
# Simplified Code

```r
now = tryCatch(getUTC(), error = function(e) NA)
if(is.na(now))
  now = tryCatch(getUTC("http://worldtimeapi.org/api/timezone/etc/UTC"), error = function(e) NA)
```

+ 3rd tryCatch() has slightly different pattern in gsub() call
   + can add make getUTC() flexible to handle that.
      + add parameter and conditional regexp pattern
      + or single regexp pattern that handles both cases

  
---
# Better use of `tryCatch( error = function(e) NA)`

+ First tryCatch() returns NA if fails
+ Then check for NA and call second tryCatch().
+ Instead, do the second tryCatch() in the error handler of the first tryCatch()

```r
now = tryCatch(getUTC(),
               error = function(e) {
                  tryCatch(getUTC("http://worldtimeapi.org/api/timezone/etc/UTC"),
                          error = function(e) NA)
                        })

```
+ caveat - if getUTC() can return NA without it being an error, then not the same thing and need two separate, sequential calls, with test for NA.

+ Why not have getUTC() do the 3 tryCatch() calls

---
# Create Test Suite

+ Whenever you change a line of code, can run tests to ensure same results.
+ Code that can be source()/evaluated programmatically
+ Checks result against expected result
   + Raises an error (`stopifnot()`, `if(cond) stop()`) if wrong result.
   + R packages testthat

---
# Parameter Default values &
   
  + lifting/hoisting/elevating expressions in body to parameters
  + allows caller more control & flexibility

    file = list.files(dir, pattern = "csv$", full.names = TRUE)
    file = file[ !file.info(file)$isdir ]
    lapply(file, foo)
}
```


---
# Alternative

+ What if
  + already computed the list of files and it is time consuming?
  + want to operate on a subset, e.g., for testing while developing function
     + will recompute list.files() each time
     + like to be able to give command
```
f ( file = myFiles[1:3] )
```


--
```r
f = function(dir, file = list.files(dir, pattern = "csv$", full.names = TRUE)) {
    file = file[ !file.info(file)$isdir ]
    lapply(file, foo)
}
```

---
# Avoid checking directories

+ How do we allow the caller indicate no need to check for directories?

--
  + an extra argument `checkDir = TRUE`
```
f(file = myFiles, checkDir = FALSE)

if(checkDir)
      file = file[ !file.info(file)$isdir ]
```
