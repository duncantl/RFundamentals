#

+ Every function has an environment
+ The environment of  function is the environment in which it is created.

+ This can be
   + top-level prompt -  global environment
   + source("showEnv.R", env)
   + inside a function call
      + specific call frame for the call to the enclosing function
      + what is the parent of a call frame?

---
+ functions created in functions
 + function(x) {
     function(parm)
        prod(dnorm(x, parm[1], parm[2]))
   }
   
 + function() {
       count = 0L
       function()
         count <<- count + 1L
   }
 + environment of functions is the call frame of the enclosing function
 + trap variables in the host/outer/parent function.
 + non-local assignments find the first location of the variable being assigned
   and assign there.

---
# Can explicity set the enviroment of a function
```r
  a = 2
  f = function(x) x + a
  f(10)
```
+ Set the environment
```r
  env = new.env()
  env$a = 101
  environment(f) = env
  f(10)
```
---
# Evaluating Arguments

+ arguments are passed lazily
+ arguments evaluated in the caller's environment/call frame

+ Consider `scatter.smooth(mtcars[, c("mpg", "wt")])`

+ scatter.smooth calls xy.coords needs the value of its x argument.

+ scatter.smooth parameter x lazily matched to `mtcars[, c("mpg", "wt")]`
+ scatter.smooth calls `xy.coords(x, y, ...)`
    + xy.coords's parameter x matched to expression `x` in scatter.smooth
+ xy.coord gets value of its `x` argument
    + evaluates expression `x` in caller (scatter.smooth's call frame)
    + that has not been evaluated yet
    + lazy expression is `mtcars[, c("mpg", "wt")]` evaluated in global environment
        from which scatter.smooth was called.

---
# Evaluating Default values of Parameters

+ f = function(dir, files = list.files(dir, ...), ...)

---
# Pass-by-value/Copy

+ argument values are "copied"/passed by value, not by reference
   + changes to an argument are local to the function
```   
      foo = function(x) {
          x[2] = 1  # local to this call to foo()
      }
```      

+ except environments, connections, external pointers
   

---
# (Semi) Non-standard Evaluation

```
source("boost.R")
```

+ `z = boost(mpg ~ wt, mtcars)`
   +   all results the same

--
+ remove weights from global environment.
   + error
```
Error in model.frame.default(formula = formula, data = data, weights = weights,  : 
  invalid type (closure) for variable '(weights)'
```
+ detach stats package
   + different error
```
Error in eval(extras, data, env) : object 'weights' not found
```


---

+ Based on the error(s), debug command 20  in model.frame.default

```r
trace(model.frame.default, browser, where = model.frame, at = 20)
```

+ Run command again - `boost(mpg ~ wt, mtcars)`

```
extras <- substitute(list(...))

extras <- eval(extras, data, env)
```

data - mtcars data.frame
env - R_GlobalEnv

---
Read documentation for eval() to understand the two arguments envir and enclos
enclose - where R looks for objects not found in envir. Here envir is a data.frame

---
Solution is we have to either
1) put weights into the data.frame in each iteration
2) change the environment of the formula to use this call frame where weights is assigned.
3) change the environment to still use the formula's current environment, but
   put a new environment in front of it in a chain.
  3a) insert a new environment in the chain immediately after the formula's environment.


2) **If** all terms in the formula are in the data.frame, then we can change the environment on the formula.
If not, we need to be able to find those external variables.
But this can be more complicated as we may have terms derived from variables in the data.frame, e.g., log(wt)
We can use code analysis to determine the names of the variables in the formula:
CodeAnalysis::getGlobals( formula )
f = mpg ~ wt + log(wt + 2) + sin(cos(disp))  - 1
getGlobals(f)$variables
[1] "mpg"  "wt"   "wt"   "disp"
If all variable names are in the data.frame, then we can change the environment of the formula
to one that contains the weights variable. This can be the current call frame
or a new environment in which we put the weights at each iteration.



1) We need to ensure name of column we use to add the weights doesn't conflict with existing name.
This example has a wt column for weight so shows opportunity to have a conflict.
See if .weights is in the data.frame. If not, use that. If it is, add random suffix and see if that is present.
Then add this to the call to lm as weights = weightsVarName
But varName has to be a symbol, not a string.
So we can create the necessary expression with

    expr = substitute(stats::lm(formula, data, weights = wvarName), list(wvarName = as.name(weightsVarName)))
Then we can eval() this in each iteration of the loop.


---

Consider the formula
 mpg ~ wt + a

a is not in the mtcars data.frame
v = CodeAnalysis::getGlobals( f)$variables
v %in% names(mtcars)

So 2) won't work.
We could put a into the data.frame


---
What if the formula is created in a function, e.g.,
 boost(  mkFormula(mtcars), mtcars)

If mkFormula was a simple as
function(data, simple = TRUE)
{
   if(simple)
     return(mpg ~ wt)

   # make complex formula
}
then the default will return a formula whose environment is the call
frame to mkFormula.

It is worth thinking about the environment on a formula.
While the default is typically appropriate, you can change it.

# on.exit() & Errors

+ When evaluating the body of a function

+ when R is about to return from that function, it evaluates any expression(s)
   registered via on.exit() in the body of that function.
  + these are evaluated in each function whether it returns or raises an error.

+ Used to reset and clean up
  + reset options(), graphics par() settings, environment variables
  + close connections opened within the function
  + reset the working directory (setwd)
  + remove temporary files

+ if there are errors
  + R raises an error **condition**
  + unwinds each call on the stack
    + evaluating each call frame's on.exit() code.
  + unwinds to top-most caller OR
     + finds a call to try() or tryCatch()

---
# Continuing Evaluation after Errors

+ try() and tryCatch()

+ Want to continue even if there is an error

```
ans = lapply(urls, function(u) try(download.file(u)))
```

```
err = sapply(ans, is, 'try-error')
```


---
# OOP: generic functions and methods

+ How did we get [.data.frame in the call stack?
  + in call to scatter.smooth()
+ model.frame.default in lm()/boost()

+ S3 methods and how they are found.

  + getS3method("generic", "className")
  + typically, found by looking for "function name.class"
  + take the class() of the object
     + character vector with possibly multiple values
        + e.g.  c("glm", "lm")
  + plot(x) would look for
      + plot.glm
      + plot.lm
      + plot.default
  + packages can "redirect" to another function not using this naming convention
      + from package relevance's NAMESPACE
```
S3method(print, termtable)
S3method(plot, termtable, plot.inference)
```

+ Writing Functions
   + often no need for explicit return. Object returned from last evaluated expression
```   
     if() 
         expr1
     else
         expr2
```	 
   + Same logic applies to {}
       + value of {cmd1; cmd2; cmd3 } is the value of the last
          command evaluated in the {} (i.e., cmd3 in this example)

   + if() statements
```   
  x = if() {
      tmp = 1
      sin(tmp + tmp^2)
  } else
       202
```

---
# Use default values to make your code more flexible.
  + allow callers to provide different values.

```
wc = 
function(dir)
{
    f = list.files(dir, full.names = TRUE)
    sapply(f, function(f) length(readLines(f)))
}
```

+ "Hoist the expression
  + Expensive to compute list.files()
      + want to be able to precompute and reuse.
  + Expensive to process all of them when testing function
      + want to be able to be able to provide subset
--
```
wc = 
function(dir, f = list.files(dir, full.names = TRUE))
{
   sapply(f, function(f) length(readLines(f)))
}
```

---
# Additional/Alternative approach

+  add ... to allow caller to customize list.files() call
   + argument matching rules tell us 
   + pass the entire collection of arguments in ... to 
```
wc = 
function(dir, ...)
{
    f = list.files(dir, full.names = TRUE, ...)
    sapply(f, function(f) length(readLines(f)))
}
```
So can be called with
```r
wc(".", pattern = ".R$")
wc(".", pattern = ".R$", recursive = TRUE)
```

---
# Combine Both Approaches

```
wc = 
function(dir, f = list.files(dir, full.names = TRUE, ...), ...)
{
    f = list.files(dir, full.names = TRUE, ...)
    sapply(f, function(f) length(readLines(f)))
}
```

+ `wc( pattern = ".R", recursive = TRUE)`

+ Note the ... in the parameter list, and also used in the default value of f
      + no problem in evaluation 
         + 
```r
match.call(wc, quote(wc(".", pattern = ".R$", recursive = TRUE)), expand.dots = FALSE)
```
      + it is slightly awkward as we need to by pass dir and f to specify arguments?
      + could do 
         `wc = function(..., dir, f = list.files(dir, ...)) `
         but then have to spell out dir and f to specify those arguments.
          `wc(dir = "~")` rather than `wc("~")`



+ Hoisting/lifting:
   + Write function first and the gradually move commands in body up to parameters.

# Vectorization

+ Question:
    + I have a 2-column data.frame with 18+ million rows. The cells are populated with alphanumeric strings.         
    + I need to append a new column with each row composed of the pasting of the sorted composition of that row, e.g.
```r
columnA      columnB     newColumn
asj123       cgyy562     asj123_cgyy562
hdsahvu      baoiw25     baoiw25_hdsahvu
ttsq         adkeoje     adkeoje_ttsq
isdii        zoosd21     isdii_zoosd21                                                                                                                             
```
    + I tried to do it rowwise, but it is taking too long.

---
# What would the row-wise version look like?
```
doit = 
function(z)
{
   ans = character(nrow(z))
   for(i in 1:nrow(z))  {
       ans[i] = if(z[i, 1] < z[i, 2])
                     paste0(z[i,1], "_", z[i,2])
                else
                     paste0(z[i,2], "_", z[i,1])
    }
    ans
}
```

+ How to vectorize this?

+ But first ....
---
# How do we create a sample data.set?
```
mkWord0 =
function()
{
    wordLen = sample(3:8, 1)
    chars = sample(c(letters, 0:9), wordLen, replace = TRUE)
    paste(chars, collapse = "")
}
```

```
col1 = replicate(N, mkWord0)
col2 = replicate(N, mkWord0)
```
+ N *2 *2  calls to sample
+ 2 * N calls to paste


---
# Vectorized Word Generation

```
mkString3 =
function(n)    
{
    wordLen = sample(3:8, n, replace = TRUE)
    chars = sample(c(letters, 0:9), sum(wordLen), replace = TRUE)
    tapply(chars, rep(1:n, wordLen), paste, collapse = "")
}  
```

+ Note can generate values for both columns in single call 
```r
tmp = mkString3( 2 * N)
matrix(tmp, , 2)
```

+ 2 calls to sample
+ n calls to paste
   + can we do better? 
   + does it matter?


---
# Back to Real Problem

+ Approaches?
+ Work on entire vector in one operation
  + or a few sub-vectors
  + divide and conquer

--

+ for all the rows for which the first column value sorts before the second,
 ```r
   paste(col1, col2, sep = "_")
```
+ for the other rows, reverse the order of pasting
```r
   paste(col2, col1, sep = "_")
```

---

```r
mkCol =
function(z)
{
    w = z$a < z$b
    z$c = "" 
    z$c[w] = paste(z$a[w], z$b[w], sep = "_")
    z$c[!w] = paste(z$b[!w], z$a[!w], sep = "_")   
    z
}
```
