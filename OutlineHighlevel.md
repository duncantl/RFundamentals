My background
Why "mastering" a language saves time and is worth the investment. See Goals.md.

Come back to: assignments in current environment, regardless of where previously defined. Two
     different instances. Why it makes sense. No side-effects. Functional programming.  Use <<- if
     you really mean, but very rarely do unless using closures.
